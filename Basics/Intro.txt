CPP? -> It's a general purpose programming language that extends the c programming language by adding features like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) while still allowing low-level memory manipulation

-> Classes and Objects:

Class:
    A class is a blueprint or template from which we can create instances/objects. They are logical only.
    
Object:
    Any real world entity can become an object. It could be physical as well as logical.


class       - Factory. It doesn't make anithing by itself.
Object      - The Product. What you actually get to use.
Methods     - The Actions. Like baking or eating.
Attributes  - The Flavor. What makes each object different.
