Abstraction:

- It is a process of simplifying complex systems by hiding the unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features to the user.

- In simple terms, abstraction allows you to focus on high-level operations while hiding the low-level implementation details.

- In order to make a class virtual, we have to atleast declare 1 pure virtual function

- Pure Virtual Function Syntax:
    virtual returntype functionname(arguments) = 0;
